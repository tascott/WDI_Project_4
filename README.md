###The Journey
 
 
- AngularJS was a completely different way of thinking, which was very challenging. I started getting to grasp with it close to the end of the project - so there is still lots to do.  
-  Getting Angular to play well with jQuery was challenging!  
-  Passport was very advanced and took days to sort out.
